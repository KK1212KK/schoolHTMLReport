<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">This will be about the up and coming third sonic movie,
it is coming out this december and i am very excited about it. From
what we know, it is about team Sonic (Sonic, Tails, and knuckles)
meeting Shadow after he breaks out of containment, Shadow trys to
destroy everything and team sonic has to stop him.</p>

<h5>Key Points that seem to be in the movie</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Shadow is a being that breaks out of what seems to be known as "Prison Island"</li>
    <li>The movie seems to be following more of a Sonic X story line, shown by maria in the trailer.</li>
    <li>The assumtion that the island that Shadow is contained on is called "Prison Island" Comes from Sonic X's Prison Island.</li>
